(ns lorawan.join-oracle-test
  "Cross-checks `lorawan.join/decode-join-accept` against the JVM's own AES,
  independent of `org-nist-aes`. Same pattern as `org-nist-aes`'s own
  `aes.oracle-test` (`javax.crypto`, JDK built-in, no new dependency).

  This is the one place LoRaWAN's Join-Accept encryption direction is easy
  to get backwards (see `lorawan.crypt`'s docstring: the join server
  ciphers with AES *decrypt*, the end-device recovers with AES *encrypt*)
  and a bug here would be exactly the kind that 'looks right' — a same-
  direction bug on both sides of a hand-written round-trip test would
  still pass. Building the ciphertext with the JDK's `Cipher` in
  `DECRYPT_MODE` (playing the join server) and feeding it to this
  library's `decode-join-accept` (playing the end-device) means the two
  halves being compared use unrelated implementations of the inverse
  cipher, so getting the direction backwards in *either* one shows up as a
  mismatch, not a pass.

  The `DevAddr`/keys/nonces below are constructed test fixtures — the
  LoRaWAN spec itself gives no worked byte-level Join-Accept example (only
  the algorithm, §6.2.6) — labeled here, not presented as spec vectors."
