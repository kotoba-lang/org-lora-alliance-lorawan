  "LoRaWAN L2 1.0.4 §4.3.3 FRMPayload encryption. No published spec test
  vectors exist for this (the spec gives only the algorithm) — every
  concrete value here is constructed and labeled so, verified instead by
  round-trip (`crypt-frm-payload` applied twice returns the original,
  because it's a keystream XOR — see the namespace docstring) and by
  agreement with a from-scratch alternate implementation of the same
  algorithm below, over a length sweep spanning the 16-byte block
  boundary."
