  encrypt-vs-decrypt-direction correctness is verified independently in
  `oracle/lorawan/join_oracle_test.clj` against the JVM's own AES — this
  suite covers Join-Request's full round trip (which this library both
  encodes and decodes) plus decode-side negative tests, and session-key
  derivation's own real property (NwkSKey ≠ AppSKey for the same nonce,
  because only the leading selector byte differs)."
